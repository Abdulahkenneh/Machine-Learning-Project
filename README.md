# Facial Reconstruction from Low-Quality CCTV Footage Using Machine Learning and Computer Vision

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based solution for enhancing and reconstructing human faces from low-quality CCTV footage. The goal is to improve the clarity of facial images captured under challenging conditions such as low light, motion blur, and various angles, making them suitable for security and surveillance purposes.

By leveraging state-of-the-art techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and image enhancement algorithms, this proof of concept (POC) addresses real-world problems in facial recognition and video analysis, laying the foundation for future advancements in real-time surveillance applications.

## Key Features
- **Facial Reconstruction**: A deep learning model to reconstruct faces from low-resolution or blurry footage, enhancing recognizability.
- **Image Enhancement**: Techniques such as super-resolution, noise reduction, and deblurring to improve image quality.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Optimized for efficient video frame processing in real-time scenarios.
- **Robust Performance Across Conditions**: Tested on footage with varying lighting conditions (warm, cold, low, medium, and bright) and multiple angles to ensure model robustness.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for developing the solution.
- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing tasks such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: For generating high-quality facial reconstructions from low-quality inputs.
- **PyTorch/TensorFlow**: Deep learning frameworks for building and training neural network models.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization tools for result comparison and data analysis.
- **OpenAI**: Leveraging advanced machine learning models and generative techniques.

## Challenges Addressed
- **Low-Light Footage**: Enhancing poorly lit footage for clearer facial recognition.
- **Motion Blur**: Mitigating motion blur effects from moving subjects in surveillance footage.
- **Multiple Angles**: Reconstructing consistent facial representations from different angles.
- **Efficient Data Compression**: Managing high-resolution video efficiently for real-time applications.

## Next Steps
- **Facial Recognition Integration**: Future development will involve integrating enhanced facial images into recognition systems for identity verification.
- **3D Facial Reconstruction**: Extending the model to generate 3D representations of faces.
- **Real-Time Video Stream Processing**: Implementing capabilities to handle live video streams for surveillance purposes.
