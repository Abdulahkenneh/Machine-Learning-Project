# **Facial Reconstruction from Low-Quality CCTV Footage Using Machine Learning and Computer Vision**

## **Hackathon Project Overview**
This hackathon project aims to develop a **machine learning-based solution** for enhancing and reconstructing human faces from **low-quality CCTV footage**, tackling common challenges such as **low-light environments**, **motion blur**, and **multi-angle views**. The primary goal is to improve facial clarity for use in **security and surveillance** systems, contributing to more accurate identification in real-world scenarios.

Leveraging **cutting-edge techniques** such as **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and **advanced image enhancement algorithms**, this Proof of Concept (POC) lays the groundwork for future advancements in **real-time surveillance** applications. The solution addresses various challenges in facial recognition and video analysis, providing robust facial reconstruction across a range of difficult conditions.

## **Problem Statement**
Low-quality CCTV footage often suffers from poor lighting, motion blur, and multiple angles, making it difficult for traditional facial recognition systems to accurately identify individuals. This hackathon project addresses these issues by applying machine learning and computer vision techniques to enhance and reconstruct facial images, significantly improving the **accuracy of facial recognition** in security systems.

## **Proposed Solution**
The solution employs **GANs** and other deep learning models to perform facial reconstruction from **low-resolution** or **blurred video frames**, along with image enhancement methods to improve the overall quality of the footage. The system is designed to be optimized for real-time video processing, making it suitable for **live surveillance** applications.

## **Key Features**
- **Facial Reconstruction**: A deep learning model reconstructs high-quality facial images from low-resolution footage or blurred frames.
- **Advanced Image Enhancement**: Techniques such as **super-resolution**, **deblurring**, and **noise reduction** improve the clarity of facial images.
- **Real-Time Processing**: The solution is optimized to process video frames in real-time, making it applicable for **live surveillance systems**.
- **Robust Across Conditions**: The model is tested on various lighting conditions (warm, cold, low, medium, bright) and **multi-angle views**, ensuring performance under diverse scenarios.

## **Technologies & Tools**
- **Python**: Core programming language used to build the solution.
- **OpenCV**: For essential image processing tasks, including normalization, resizing, and augmentation of input footage.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Key technology for generating high-quality facial reconstructions.
